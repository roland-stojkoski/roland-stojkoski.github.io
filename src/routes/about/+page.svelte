		I'm a System Development Engineer who loves all things tech and how it can make a positive
		impact on the world. My passion lies in reducing complexity, automation, big data and
		networking. I've tackled every aspect of software development, from design to testing, and have
		a strong grip on big data, automation and cloud computing.

		I am always seeking new challenges and opportunities to expand my skillset. I have a particular
		interest in exploring blockchain systems, multi-cloud provider tools and building the next
		generation of the Internet. I believe in using technology for the greater good and I am a firm
		believer that community drives the software.
