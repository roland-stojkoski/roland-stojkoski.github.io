## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.

## Deploying 

To deploy the production version to Github:

```bash
npm run deploy
```

Go to - https://github.com/<username>/<username>.github.io/deployments and check if the deployment succeeded.

Open https://<username>.github.io .

## Formatting

To run the formatter:

```bash
npm run format
```

Then check with the linter:
```bash
npm run lint
```
